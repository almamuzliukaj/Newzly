# 📰 Newzly

## Project Description

**Newzly** is a full-stack web application developed to aggregate and display news articles from external sources using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application enables users to register, log in, and browse categorized news from around the world, with an organized and responsive user interface.

The system supports secure JWT-based user authentication and is built using a modular architecture that allows for scalability and organized development. News content is grouped by topics and countries, providing users with a structured browsing experience.
